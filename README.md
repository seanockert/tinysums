# Tiny Sums

A little text area that lets you calculate stuff with natural language

Based on PEG parser, allows you to set variables and do back of the envelope calculations line by line. Useful for when you don't need something as complex as a spreadsheet.  

(Demo here)[https://so-tinysums.surge.sh]

### Example:
days = 15

food: $12 * days 
> $180

transport: $3.50 * days 
> $52.50

sum 
> food + transport = $232.50
